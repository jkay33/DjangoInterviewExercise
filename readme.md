Simple application that can store and manage appointments
Appointments should be persisted in a datastore

The application should have REST endpoints that do the following
- Delete appointments-
- Create new appointments-
- Update the status of an existing appointment-
- Retrieve a specific appointment from the database-
- Retrieve all appointments that are scheduled between a date range and sorted by price-
  (list items with "-" suffix represent implemented, place holder for developer)

Additionally an appointment scheduler function should create new appointments at a random interval.
